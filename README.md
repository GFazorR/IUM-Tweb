# IUM-Tweb

This is the repository of my project for the course "Human Machine Interactions and Web Technologies".


This repository contains the Back-end, Front-end and mobile application for a booking service for courses repetitions.

The back-end and the mobile app are written in java, while the frontend uses the Vue.js framework.
